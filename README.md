The middle-priced houses are located in Mentougou District and Shijingshan District.
Additionally, it is determined that the interior of the house has also play a role in house pricing. The number of living rooms has positive correlation with the house. However, it is strange that the area of the house has no direct relation with the price. But after stratifying the total price variable it is found that there is some positive correlation between are and price of the house.
Moreover, it is found that there is no relation between the type of the building and the price of the house.

However, there was no apparent relation between the price and building type.
In nutshell, the location of the house has highest effect on the prices of houses in Beijing
